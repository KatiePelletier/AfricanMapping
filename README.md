# AfricanMapping


This is the landing page for all my scripts for my project mapping variants contributing to shape and size divergance in African populations 

Raw sequence data will be deposited on to NCBI short read archive ASAP. All sequencing data is 150bp paired end reads (prepared and sequenced by Genome Quebec) 

Morpometric shape data is a mix of spline data (58 avalible dimentions) colleted with the WINGMACHINE pipeline and 15 landmark (26 avalible dimentions) collected with the Fiji macro. See assosiated paper for more details on each method. 

The goal of this project was to identify loci contributing to wing shape and size divergance between lowland and highland popualtions of Drosophila melanogaster using an advanced intercross approach. Nearly isogenic inbred lines from each population were crossed together for 20 non-overlapping generations. F20 projeny were phenotyped and scored for both size and shape. Sequenced pools consisted of the 50 most extreme individuals along both the shape and size axis.
